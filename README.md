# Coffee Hub

# CoffeeHub Project Documentation

## Overview

CoffeeHub is a modern web application designed as a marketplace for coffee enthusiasts. The platform allows users to explore and purchase coffee, learn about roasters and producers, visualize flavor profiles, and discover geographic origins of coffee. The project is currently powered by a robust and scalable tech stack and is structured to enable future enhancements, including a recommendation engine.

---

## Current Setup

### **Core Technologies**

- **Frontend:**

  - **React 18.3**: Dynamic and interactive UI.
  - **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript for improved reliability.
  - **Vite**: Fast build tool and dev server for rapid development.

- **UI & Styling:**

  - **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for modern designs.
  - **shadcn/ui**: React component library for consistent and reusable components.
  - **Lucide React**: Icon library for a sleek and intuitive interface.

- **Data Visualization:**

  - **Recharts**: Charting library for visualizing statistics and metrics.
  - **Mapbox GL**: Interactive maps for visualizing coffee origins.

- **Routing:**

  - **React Router DOM**: Client-side routing with support for nested and dynamic routes.

### **Project Structure**

```

### **Features**

- Coffee browsing with filters.
- Detailed coffee information pages.
- Roaster and producer profiles.
- Interactive flavor maps.
- User reviews and ratings.
- Geographic visualization of coffee origins.

### **Current Data Setup**

All data is currently mocked but structured to allow for seamless integration with real API calls in the future.

## Next Steps to Elevate the Project

### **1. Backend Integration**

Transition from mocked data to real APIs for dynamic and real-time data.

- **API Design:**

  - Use **REST API** for straightforward resource management or **GraphQL** for flexible data fetching.

- **Backend Frameworks:**

  - **Node.js + Express.js**: Lightweight and aligns with the current JavaScript/TypeScript stack.
  - **Django (Python):** Ideal for leveraging Python-based machine learning for future features.
  - **NestJS (TypeScript):** Provides a more structured and scalable option for backend development.

---

### **2. Database Design**

Implement a well-structured relational database to replace mocked data.

**Recommended Database: PostgreSQL**

**Schema Example:**

- **Coffees Table:**

  - `id`, `name`, `roaster_id`, `producer_id`, `flavor_profiles`, `price`, `origin`, `body`, `mouthfeel`, `acidity`, `sweetness`, `bitterness`, `rating`

- **Roasters Table:**

  - `id`, `name`, `description`, `location`

- **Producers Table:**

  - `id`, `name`, `location`, `description`

- **User Reviews Table:**

  - `id`, `user_id`, `coffee_id`, `rating`, `review_text`, `created_at`

---

### **3. Recommendation Engine**

Build a recommendation engine to personalize the user experience.

- **Data to Collect:**

  - Coffee views, clicks, and ratings.
  - User preferences (e.g., favorite flavors or regions).
  - Purchase history and reviews.

- **Recommendation Models:**

  - **Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends coffees based on user similarities.
  - **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends coffees with similar attributes (e.g., flavor profiles, origins).
  - **Hybrid Approach:** Combines both methods for improved accuracy.

- **Technologies:**

  - **Python:** Use Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for building ML models.
  - **Data Storage:** MongoDB for interaction logs or PostgreSQL with analytics tables.

---

### **4. Advanced Search and Filters**

Enhance search and filtering functionality with a dedicated search engine.

- **Technologies:**
  - **Elasticsearch** or **Meilisearch** for full-text search and faceted filtering.

**Examples:**

- Search coffee by name, flavor profiles, or regions.
- Filters for price range, rating, and processing methods.

---

### **5. Real-Time Features**

Introduce real-time updates for reviews and ratings.

- **Technologies:**
  - Use **WebSockets** or **Firebase** to enable live updates.

**Examples:**

- Display new user reviews and ratings without page reloads.
- Real-time inventory or availability updates.

---

### **6. Deployment**

Ensure scalable and reliable hosting for both frontend and backend.

- **Frontend:**

  - Host on **Vercel** or **Netlify** for seamless React/Vite hosting.
  - Use a **CDN** for assets like images.

- **Backend:**

  - Host on **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, or **Heroku**.
  - Use **Docker** for containerized deployment.

- **Database:**

  - Use managed database services like **AWS RDS (PostgreSQL)** or **Google Cloud SQL**.

---

### **7. Analytics and Monitoring**

Track user behavior and monitor application performance.

- **Analytics:**

  - **Google Analytics** or **Mixpanel** to track user interactions.

- **Monitoring:**

  - Use **Sentry** or **Datadog** for error tracking and performance monitoring.

---

### **8. SEO Optimization**

Optimize the site for search engines to drive organic traffic.

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG):**

  - Use **Next.js** to enhance SEO and improve page load times.

- **Metadata and Schema Markup:**

  - Add Open Graph tags and schema.org markup for coffee detail pages.

---

### **Updated Tech Stack Recommendation**

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS (current setup works great).
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express.js/NestJS) or Django (Python).
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (primary) + Redis (caching).
- **Search Engine:** Elasticsearch or Meilisearch.
- **Machine Learning:** Python (Scikit-learn/TensorFlow).
- **Hosting:** Vercel (frontend) + AWS/Heroku (backend).
